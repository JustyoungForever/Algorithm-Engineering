## SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions)
- **Purpose**: Designed to accelerate floating point calculations.
- **Features**: Supports Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) operations, allowing multiple data processing simultaneously.
- **Applications**: Mainly used in graphics processing, gaming, and multimedia handling.

## AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions)
- **Purpose**: Provides more advanced SIMD capabilities than SSE.
- **Features**: Supports wider vectors, enabling processing of more data.
- **Applications**: Used in high-performance computing tasks like scientific computations and engineering simulations.

## AVX2
- **Features**: Includes enhancements for integer instructions and new bit manipulation capabilities.
- **Applications**: Similar to AVX but offers improved processing capabilities.

## AVX-512
- **Features**: Offers even wider vector lengths (512 bits), supporting more parallel operations.
- **Applications**: Used in the most demanding high-performance computing areas, such as scientific research and big data analysis.
