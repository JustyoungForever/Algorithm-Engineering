## Preference for Structure of Arrays in Memory Arrangement

The preference for arranging records in memory as a Structure of Arrays (SoA) instead of an Array of Structures (AoS) is influenced by several factors:

### Improved Cache Utilization
- SoA improves cache efficiency in tight loops that involve only a few fields. Data is more concentrated, reducing the loading of irrelevant cache lines.

### Vectorization Operations
- SoA format is more suitable for SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations. The continuous storage of the same type of data allows for more effective use of modern processor vectorization instructions.

### Reduced Memory Usage
- SoA can reduce memory bandwidth waste when only a few fields of the structure are accessed, as it avoids loading unnecessary data.

### Parallel Processing
- SoA facilitates more efficient parallel processing of data in multi-threading or distributed systems. Each thread can independently process a segment of the array, reducing data dependencies and inter-thread communication.
